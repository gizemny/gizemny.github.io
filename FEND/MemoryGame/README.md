## Instructions 
Step 1: Click on a card to reveal hidden symbol.

Step 2: Click another card. If there is no match, the cards will close. 

Step 3: Repeat step 1 & 2 until you find all the matches. 

Game ends when all cards are matched. A pop up will display the amount of time it took you to finish, and the rating based on how many moves you made. Finish the game in less moves to get a higher rating. Enjoy!
