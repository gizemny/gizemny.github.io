# MyReads Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I used the starter code provided by Udacity and added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code.

## To view
* Download or clone the repo
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server
Backend was provided & project uses [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) which contains the methods to perform necessary operations. The API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
